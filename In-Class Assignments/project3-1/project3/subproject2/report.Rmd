# Regression Analysis

## Primary model

```{r, fit-primary-model}
both_regression_tables <- readRDS(
  file = #! TO DO: add appropriate file path to subproject2/output
)
both_regression_tables$primary
```

## Secondary model

In this analysis, we generated a binary outcome where level 1 of the outcome
means the antibody resistance score was greater than 1.

```{r, secondary-model}
both_regression_tables$secondary
```
